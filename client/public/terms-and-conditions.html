    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 22, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing and using RiskLo ("the Service"), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. 
      If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Not Financial Advice</h2>
    <p>
      RiskLo is NOT a financial advisory service and does NOT provide financial, investment, or trading advice. 
      The information, data, calculations, and risk assessments provided by RiskLo are for informational and educational purposes only 
      and should not be construed as professional financial advice, investment recommendations, or a solicitation to buy or sell any financial instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that RiskLo is a risk assessment tool that uses historical data and statistical probability calculations. 
      All results are estimates based on past performance and do not guarantee future results.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Historical Data & Probability</h2>
    <p>
      All risk assessments, calculations, and suggestions displayed by RiskLo are based solely on historical performance data and statistical probability. 
      Past performance does not guarantee future results. Market conditions, volatility, and trading outcomes can change dramatically and unpredictably.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important Note:</strong> Trailing drawdown is based on intraday maximum adverse excursion (MAE), not end-of-day P&L. 
      This means a trade could close positive but still blow the account if it exceeded the drawdown limit during the day. 
      RiskLo uses end-of-day P&L data, so actual risk may be higher than shown.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Guarantees or Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      RiskLo makes NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of any information, 
      calculations, or risk assessments provided. RiskLo does not guarantee that following any suggestions will result in profits or prevent losses. 
      Trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for everyone.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for all trading decisions, investment choices, and financial actions you take. You acknowledge that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You understand that trading involves the risk of substantial financial loss</li>
      <li>You have the knowledge and experience necessary to make independent trading decisions</li>
      <li>You will not hold RiskLo liable for any losses, damages, or consequences resulting from your use of this tool</li>
      <li>You will consult with qualified financial professionals before making any significant trading or investment decisions</li>
      <li>You understand that RiskLo's calculations may be inaccurate, incomplete, or based on outdated data</li>
      <li>You will use RiskLo at your own risk and discretion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RiskLo, its owners, operators, employees, affiliates, and partners shall not be liable for any direct, 
      indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to trading losses, lost profits, or other financial losses, 
      arising from or related to your use of or reliance on RiskLo.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>
      RiskLo reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time, with or without notice. 
      We do not guarantee that the Service will be available at all times or that it will be free from errors or interruptions.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Accounts</h2>
